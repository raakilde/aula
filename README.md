# Aula

This is a custom component for Home Assistant to integrate Aula. It is very much based on the great work by @JBoye at https://github.com/JBoye/HA-Aula and https://github.com/scaarup/aula. Adding additional features:

- Support for MinUddannelse (UVData)
    - Forl√∏b
    - SSO
    - Opgaver
- Bibliotek (Systemmatic A/S)
